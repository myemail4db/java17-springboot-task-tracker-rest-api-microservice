# 🧱 High-Level Design (HLD)

## 1. 📌 **Overview**
This application is designed using a layered architecture that separates concerns between presentation, service, and persistence layers. It follows the typical enterprise microservice structure with clear responsibilities and support for scalability, maintainability, and testability.

## 2. 🔄 **Data Flow Summary**
```
[Client/UI] → [REST Controller] → [Service Layer] → [Repository Layer] → [Database]
                                                       ↓
                                                  [Logging Layer]
```

## 3. ⚙️ **Components**
| Component        | Responsibility                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Controller       | Accept HTTP requests, validate input, route to service                          |
| Service          | Business logic, orchestrates between controller and repository                 |
| Repository       | JPA interface for DB access                                                     |
| Model            | Entity class mapped to database                                                 |
| DTO              | Data Transfer Objects for request/response validation                           |
| Exception Layer  | Centralized error handling and response formatting                              |
| Logging          | SLF4J-based structured logging for tracing and debugging                        |
| Config           | Profile-based configuration for dev and prod                                   |

## 4. 📘 **API Contracts** (Planned)
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/{id}` - Get a task by ID

## 5. 🔐 **Security (Enterprise Ready)**
- JWT-based stateless authentication (planned for extension)
- Role-based access (admin/user separation)

## 6. 📦 **Deployment Strategy**
- Use `java -jar` to deploy packaged JAR
- Environment-specific configs through profiles
- Logs written to console and `logs/app.log`
