## Project Overview

This project is a full-featured, **enterprise-grade REST API microservice** built using Java 17 and Spring Boot 3. It simulates a task tracking system that demonstrates how to design, implement, test, document, and deploy a real-world backend application. It also incorporates features from the Java 17 Developer Certification to reinforce modern language capabilities.

---

## Purpose of the Project

To build a professional, maintainable RESTful backend microservice that follows full SDLC practices â€” including requirements gathering, high-level and detailed design documentation, development, testing, deployment, and CI/CD setup. The project is designed to:
- Serve as a **resume-quality artifact**
- Demonstrate **Java 17 certification features**
- Simulate real-world enterprise application design and structure

---

## Purpose of the Application

This RESTful Task Tracker application allows users (or client applications) to:
- Create new tasks
- Retrieve existing tasks
- Filter tasks by title, date, and status

It models a clean, modular architecture that enables:
- Data validation
- Custom error handling
- Complete test coverage
- API documentation
- Logging and environment separation

---

## Project Planning

### Functional Scope
- Full CRUD functionality for tasks
- Filter/search by title, completion, date
- DTO validation using `@Valid`
- Global exception handling
- REST API endpoints documented with OpenAPI (Swagger UI)

### Non-Functional Scope
- 100% test coverage (unit + integration via JUnit 5, Mockito, MockMvc)
- SLF4J logging across all layers (traceable flow)
- Logback output to console and file
- Separate dev and prod environment configs
- Executable JAR build with Maven
- Incorporates Java 17 features:
  - `record` for DTOs
  - `sealed` exceptions
  - Pattern matching
  - Enhanced `switch` statements
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (build/test)

## Architecture & Documentation

- High-Level Design (HLD): System context, layered architecture, request/response flow  
- Detailed Design (DD): Component breakdown, DTOs, service interactions, class responsibilities  
- Logging strategy: trace-level observability across components  
- API contracts and Swagger UI endpoint documentation
